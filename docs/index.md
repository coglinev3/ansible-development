# Development environment for Ansible

This is a multi node [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/ "Vagrant")/[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/ "VirtualBox")
environment which represents a real life [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/ "Ansible")
scenario with one Ansible management node and different Linux OS nodes (Ansible
clients):

* CentOS 6, 
* CentOS 7, 
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr),
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus),
* Ubuntu 17.10 (Artful Aardvark),
* Debian 8 (Jessie) and
* Debian 9 (Stretch).

It is desigend for developing Ansible playbooks and roles and testing them on
these operating systems. The configuration can be easily changed to support
other Linux distributions as well.
